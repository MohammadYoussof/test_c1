# H-k-stacking

This repository contains software to perform H-k stacking of receiver functions (RF) to estimate crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio as in Zhu and Kanamori (2000).

-time_to_hk.c converts a single time-domain RF to an H-k-domain RF.

-hk_stacking.c performs stacking and normalization of multiple H-k-domain RF, and outputs a file containing H, Vp/Vs, and Amplitude which can be easily plotted.

-bootstrap.c computes standard error and correlation of the H-k stack via the bootstrap method.



REQUIREMENTS

    -SAC library. Check the SAC manual (https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/) before compiling.
